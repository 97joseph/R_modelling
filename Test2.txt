#   Using dplyr functions (i.e., filter, mutate ,select, summarise, group_by etc. ) and "murder" dataset (available in dslab  R package) and write appropriate R syntax to answer the followings: 
#a. Calculate regional total murder excluding the OH, AL, and AZ  
#b. Display the regional population and regional murder numbers. 
#c. How many states are there in each region?  
#d. What is Ohio's murder rank in the Northern Central Region (Hint: use rank(), row_number()) 
#e. How many states have murder number greater than its regional average.  
#f. Display 2 least populated states in each region
